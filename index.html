    After all the battles we faught together, after all the difficult times we saw together, after all the good and bad moments we've been through, I think it's time I let you know how I feel about you.
  </p>
  <h2>You are the light of my life</h2>
  <p>
    You complete my darkness with your light. I love:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the way you love me</li>
    <li>the way you accept me</li>
    <li>the way you look at my emotions</li>
	<li>the way you react on my madness</li>
    <li>the way you call me "AAP PAGAL HO"</li>
    <li>and the biggest thing I LOVEEEEEEEE YOUEEEEEEE GUDUUUU</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I have learned a lot from you. You have occupied a special place in my heart over the time. And, actually you took my heart.
  </p>
  
  <h2>I have a confession to make</h2>
  <p>
    It feels like my chest <em>does</em> have a heart. You make my heart beat. Your smile brings smile on my face, your pain brings pain to my heart.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>I love you Superwomen.</strong></p>
  <p>
    YOU ARE MY LIFE.
	<br>
	YOU ARE MINE. NEVER LEAVE ME PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE....
	<br>
	I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH.....
